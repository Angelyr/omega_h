/* on BlueGene/Q the default install
 * defines MPICH2_CONST to empty if we
 * don't define it first, causing tons
 * of compile errors.
 *
 * in addition, the mpicxx.h header is full
 * of "const MPICH2_CONST", probably as a workaround
 * for the first mistake above.
 * as a result, properly defining MPICH2_CONST to const
 * also causes compile errors.
 * luckily, we can avoid including mpicxx.h with
 * MPICH_SKIP_MPICXX.
